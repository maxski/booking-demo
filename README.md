*Run:* mvn test

*Reports:* standart TestNG report located in target/surefire-reports folder

*Known issues:* Tests are written for old Calendar used for entering dates (separate Day and Month fields) in Booking.com search. If test failed, please re-run again. Seems, different server instances have different versions.
